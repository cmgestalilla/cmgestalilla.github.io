    <h4> <LI> Anna Dressed in Blood (by: Kendare Blake) </LI> </h4>
    <p> In a world of ghosts and ghost hunters, Cas Lowood, a teenager with a knack for killing ghosts finds himself in a new town where he meets his match: A dead, slavic girl that haunts a house where people seemed to have disappeared. Little did he know that they would fall so intimately for each other amidst troubled times, dangerous times where the hunter can also be the hunted. </p>
    
    <p> <strong> Main Characters: </strong> Cas Lowood and Anna Korlov </p>
    
    <h4> Book Synopsis </h4>
    <p> Cas Lowood has inherited an unusual vocation: He kills the dead. </p>
    
    <p> So did his father before him, until his gruesome murder by a ghost he sought to kill. Now, armed with his father's mysterious and deadly athame, Cas travels the country with his kitchen-witch mother and their spirit-sniffing cat. Together they follow legends and local lore, trying to keep up with the murderous deadâ€”keeping pesky things like the future and friends at bay. </p>
    
    <p> When they arrive in a new town in search of a ghost the locals call Anna Dressed in Blood, Cas doesn't expect anything outside of the ordinary: move, hunt, kill. What he finds instead is a girl entangled in curses and rage, a ghost like he's never faced before. She still wears the dress she wore on the day of her brutal murder in 1958: once white, but now stained red and dripping blood. Since her death, Anna has killed any and every person who has dared to step into the deserted Victorian she used to call home. </p>
    
    <p> And she, for whatever reason, spares his life. </p>
    
    <h4> Book Review </h4>
    <p> Anna Dressed in Blood is an unexpected, emotional, humorous, amazing read. Kendare Blake makes use of a fictional world of ghosts and ghost killers but brings in a new flavor into the mix. This added touch is brought by the romantic element of Cas lowood and his love interest, a ghost which he was about to kill, Anna. </p> 
    
    <p> The book gets very interesting as the plot progresses as readers are brought into the life of a girl who is already dead. We learn how she died, sympathize with her, and support the bond of this ghost hunter and the ghost that were brought together in unexpected circumstances. </p>
    
    <p> All other characters in the story such as Carmel and Thomas are good supporting elements of the book as this brings more life into Cas' already gloomy and morbid world of killing ghosts in town after town. Amidst the action, suspense, and drama in this book there is also a very humorous and relatable element with Cas' story. We as readers see how much more complete he is when Anna came into his life and we cherish this very much. </p>
        
    <p> The ending of the book was bitter-sweet, as Anna disappeared into the abyss with Cas' final moments with her. Readers are left with an empty yet very meaningful ending which brings anticipation for the book's sequel, "Girl of Nightmares." </p>
