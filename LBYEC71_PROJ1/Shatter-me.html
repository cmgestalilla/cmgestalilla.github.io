     <p> <strong> Main Characters: </strong> Juliette Ferrars, Aaron Warner, and Adam Kent </p>
    
<H4> Book Synopsis </H4>
    <p>
        <em>Juliette hasn’t touched anyone in exactly 264 days. </em>
    </p>
    <p> The last time she did, it was an accident, but The Reestablishment locked her up for murder. No one knows why Juliette’s touch is fatal. As long as she doesn’t hurt anyone else, no one really cares. The world is too busy crumbling to pieces to pay attention to a 17-year-old girl. Diseases are destroying the population, food is hard to find, birds don’t fly anymore, and the clouds are the wrong color. </p>
    <p> The Reestablishment said their way was the only way to fix things, so they threw Juliette in a cell. Now so many people are dead that the survivors are whispering war – and The Reestablishment has changed its mind. Maybe Juliette is more than a tortured soul stuffed into a poisonous body. Maybe she’s exactly what they need right now. </p>
    <p> Juliette has to make a choice: <em> Be a weapon. Or be a warrior. </em> </p>
    
<H4> Book Review: </H4>
    <p>
    <em> Shatter Me (Series) </em> has such a distinct cover page, an unusual eye placed in the center of the page. It draws a reader's attention to it almost immediately as if the eye is attracting or hypnotizing the person to get it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    In this dystopian novel, Juliette thinks the crumbling world has already forgotten her for being locked up for 264 days. When Warner, a madman, seeks to use her abilities for his own personal gain, a boy from her past is her only chance of escape. As their plans to run solidify, Juliette learns that there’s a fine line between being a monster and becoming a hero.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    In <em> Shatter Me, </em> the first few lines in the first chapter already hooked me into reading it. It immediately captured my attention and made me read the book continuously. The novel also had this kind of "crossed-out" phrases or sentences to know the main character's thoughts which she wanted to say but could not say.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    This series is a <em> MUST READ </em> for everyone because it has really great stories and shocking twists which will make the readers turn the pages of the book non-stop, would want to know what happens next, and get really excited for the sequels.
    </p>
    
    <p> Lastly, one thing this book really does discuss is identity, and what it means to be human. Does loving and wanting to be loved make us human? Does choosing kindness over causing harm make us human? I think it’s a very good question, and Mafi discusses this with Juliette’s character, and her choice of actions regarding the power she has been cursed with.</p>
