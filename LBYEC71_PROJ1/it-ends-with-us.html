    <h4> <LI> It Ends With Us (by: Colleen Hoover) </LI> </h4>
<P> 
    <em> It Ends With Us </em> is a novel by <em> New York Times </em> bestselling author Colleen Hoover. In this novel, it points out that pain sometimes comes from the person who is closest to us or who we love most.
</P>
     <p> <strong> Main Characters: </strong> Lily Blossom, Ryle Kincaid, and Atlas </p>
    
<H4> Book Synopsis </H4>
<P> Lily hasn’t always had it easy, but that’s never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She’s come a long way from the small town in Maine where she grew up. She graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid everything in Lily’s life suddenly seems almost too good to be true.</P>

<p> Ryle is assertive, stubborn, and maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant and has a total soft spot for Lily; and the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head, but Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his no dating rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place. </p>

<p> As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan, her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened. </p>

<p> With this bold and deeply personal novel Colleen Hoover delivers a heart-wrenching story that breaks exciting new ground for her as a writer. Combining a captivating romance with a cast of all too human characters, “It Ends with Us” is an unforgettable tale of love that comes at the ultimate price. </p>

<H4> Book Review: </H4>
    <p> <em> It Ends With Us </em> is an <em> unputdownable </em> and a <em> MUST READ. </em> The moment I read this book, I did not let go of it, not even once. The book will make you go through a whirlwind of emotions. It will make you feel the butterflies in your stomach, get mad or affected for unknown reasons, and make you bawl like a child (Reminder: Get tissue while reading this book).
        
    <p> This novel is one of the best novels that I have ever read in my entire life. I have always loved Colleen Hoover's books because each book has its own unique story, BUT THIS ONE LEFT A LASTING MARK ON MY HEART. After reading this book, I couldn't get over it which lead me not wanting to read any other books for a while because of how the story went and how it affected me. I even told my cousin about its effect on me, and she said that her co-workers also felt the same after reading the book.  </p>
    
    <p> This book is truly one of the most heart-wrenching and tear jerker novel that I have ever read. I just couldn't stop myself from getting sad for the characters and from feeling emotional as this book felt so real while I was reading it. </p>
    
    <p> I have to say that this book would seriously make an <em> AMAZING and INCREDIBLE movie </em>. I could already picture the scenes and characters in my head while I was reading the book. I really do hope that one day this makes it to the big screen, and I seriously hope that the movie will give justice to the book and wouldn't fail expectations since the book is beyond PERFECT for a reader like me. Expect me to be one of the first people to line up as soon as it shows in the cinemas. </p>
