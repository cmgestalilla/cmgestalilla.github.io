<h1> MESSAGE TO THE READER...</h1>         
<p> Books, no matter how thick or thin they are, they contain stories that compel, excite, frustrate, react, and make us think. In my opinion, the true effect of books as an art form is in the fictional genre. It's quite amazing that more fictional books are made each year as this shows to us readers and non-readers alike that man's ideas are endless and have the ability to affect and touch our whole society. This is why I have created this Top 5 fiction books of all time in my opinion. Enjoy!  </p>

It is about the story of <em> A,</em> a person who wakes up in a different body each day.

So what happens when <em> A </em> meets a girl who is the girlfriend of Justin, the body that <em> A </em> occupied for a day?
