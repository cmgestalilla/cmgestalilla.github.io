    <h4> <LI> Beautiful Disaster (by: Jamie McGuire) </LI> </h4>
<p> <em> Beautiful Disaster </em> is an adult novel by American author Jamie McGuire. This book is the typical good-girl-bad-boy-fell-in-love-with-each-other story. But there are twists and events that you would not expect from the story which makes it good and interesting.  </p>
    
    <p> <strong> Main Characters: </strong> Travis Maddox and Abby Abernathy </p>
    
    
    <h4> Book Synopsis </h4>
    <p>The new Abby Abernathy is a good girl. She doesn’t drink or swear, and she has the appropriate number of cardigans in her wardrobe. Abby believes she has enough distance from the darkness of her past, but when she arrives at college with her best friend, her path to a new beginning is quickly challenged by Eastern University’s Walking One-Night Stand. </p>

    <p> Travis Maddox, lean, cut, and covered in tattoos, is exactly what Abby needs—and wants—to avoid. He spends his nights winning money in a floating fight ring, and his days as the ultimate college campus charmer. Intrigued by Abby’s resistance to his appeal, Travis tricks her into his daily life with a simple bet. If he loses, he must remain abstinent for a month. If Abby loses, she must live in Travis’s apartment for the same amount of time. Either way, Travis has no idea that he has met his match. </p>
    
    <h4> Book Review </h4>
    <p> <em> INTENSE. DANGEROUS. ADDICTIVE. </em></p>
    
    <p> The title of this book, <em> Beautiful Disaster, </em> perfectly describes the relationship that the main characters, Abby and Travis, has. It's like the result when a good girl falls in love with the bad boy, and vice versa. Beautiful, yet disastrous.  </p>
    
    <p> This book is definitely an emotional roller coaster. The book was written in a way that the reader would feel like they are in the story too. Personally speaking, when I read this book, I felt each scene and line. With that being said, it was really hard for me to put down the book because I wanted the story to keep on going and make no pauses. So if you decide to read it, just be prepared for not wanting to put it down until they have their own happily-ever-after. Also, be ready to fall in love with Abby and Travis' passionate battle to leave their pasts behind and move forward to a brighter future hand-in-hand together </p>
    
    <p> Some readers and reviewers said that this book is controversial and not good for some reasons, but we must always put into mind that this novel is <em> fictional </em> and is only here for entertainment purposes. So setting the controversial "issues" aside, I personally think that this book is a MUST READ for open-minded readers because it really is a good book as long as you just enjoy it and not think too bad about it. </p>
    
    <p> Whether you like Beautiful Disaster or not, the one thing this book undeniably does is make you think. The couple and the story stick with you long after you put the book down. For me, this was a great story, but I will admit that it isn’t for everyone. It is a real love-it-or-hate-it book and for speaking only for myself, I loved it! </p>
