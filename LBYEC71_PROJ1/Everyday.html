    <h4> <LI> Everyday (by: David Levithan) </LI> </h4>
    <p> <em> Every Day </em> is a <em> New York Times Bestseller </em> young adult romance and fantasy novel written by author David Levithan. It is about the story of <em> A,</em> a person who wakes up in a different body each day. <em> A </em> does not have a real name, presumably because they don't really exist physically; they're not a person, but they have a spirit, switching without choice from one host to the next in just 24 hours.  </p>
    
     <p> <strong> Main Characters: </strong> A and Rhiannon </p>
    
<h4> Book Synopsis </h4>
    <p> <em> I wake up. </em> </p>

    <p> <em> Immediately, I have to figure out who I am. It’s not just the body – opening my eyes and discovering whether the skin on my arm is light or dark, whether my hair is long or short, whether I’m fat or thin, boy or girl, scarred or smooth. The body is the easiest thing to adjust to, if you’re used to waking up in a new one each morning. It’s the life, the context of the body, that can be hard to grasp. </em> </p>

    <p> <em> Every day I am someone else. I am myself – I know I am myself – but I am also someone else. </em> </p>

    <p> <em> It has always been like this. </em> </p>

    <p> <em> Every day a different body. Every day a different life. Every day in love with the same girl.There’s never any warning about where it will be or who it will be. A has made peace with that, even established guidelines by which to live: Never get too attached. Avoid being noticed. Do not interfere. </em> </p>

    <p> It’s all fine until the morning that A wakes up in the body of Justin and meets Justin’s girlfriend, Rhiannon. From that moment, the rules by which A has been living no longer apply. Because finally A has found someone he wants to be with—day in, day out, day after day. </p>

    <h4> Book Review </h4>
    <p> The story starts off with <em> A </em> waking up in the body of teenage boy named Justin. Upon arriving to school, <em> A </em> meets Justin's girlfriend, Rhiannon, and feels an instant connection with her. But soon after, <em> A </em> would be in a different body, so <em> A </em> must find ways to reach or see Rhiannon, and also come up with an explanation on what his/her situation is. </p>
    
    <p> The plot of the novel was brilliant. David Levithan described the emotions and thoughts of the characters so well. The interesting about this book was that <em> A </em> lived the life of a range of people of different appearances, diverse sexual orientations, gender identification, race, and characteristics, not just one type. </p>
    
    <p> With <em> Every Day </em> author David Levithan has given readers genderless, faceless and virtually nameless protagonist who still manages to capture the readers' hearts. This book also proves that a person can still fall in love with someone for who they truly are and not just for their physical appearance or attributes. </p>
    
    <p> I loved this book. It was romantic, cute, happy, sad, emotional, strange and beautiful at the same time. The only problem with this book was that it had an abrupt ending. I expected more for the ending, but I guess that's what the author wanted the readers to feel. Wanting for more since it was an open-ended novel. You can't really tell what will happen next unless David Levithan continues the story. </p>
    
    <p> I personally think that this book NEEDS a squel because there are so many questions left unanswered. There is a 'sequel' entitled <em> Another Day </em>, but it's not really much of a sequel because it's just basically the whole story of Every Day in Rhiannon's point of view. </p>
